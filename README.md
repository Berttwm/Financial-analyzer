# Financial Analyzer 

Have you ever wanted to automate your quantitative stock assessments? **Val** is an AI-powered program that analyses historical data to 
quickly calculate quantitative scores for your favorite stock symbols. **Val** is currently in production for version 1.0, which will provide both an overall score 
and category scores for each stock you enter.

> Version 1.0 of **Val** uses value investing metrics and scoring inspired by the book "Warren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements" by 
David Clark and Mary Buffett. **Val's** metrics and scoring are based on value investing principles of Warren Buffett, and they are designed to help 
investors identify undervalued companies.

> Version 2.0 of **Val** will use artificial intelligence (AI) and historical data analysis to further improve its ability to analyze companies. 
AI will allow **Val** to learn from historical data and identify patterns that may not be visible to human analysts.
